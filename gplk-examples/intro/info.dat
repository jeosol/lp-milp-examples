;; gplk error
glpsol: error while loading shared libraries: libglpk.so.40: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

The above error was fixed by creating a link to the above library (which is
installed in usr/local/lib64) in /usr/lib64. After this is done, running
"glpsol --lp test-plan.lp" does run without problems
